## 💡 Solution Approach

We started by brainstorming ideas together and selecting one that aligned well with the week's objectives. Using a shared planning document, we divided tasks based on individual strengths and interests. Our process included:

- 📋 **Wireframing & Planning** – Using Figma/whiteboards to structure our layout.
- 🔧 **Tech Stack** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or with frameworks, if allowed).
- 🔁 **GitHub Collaboration** – We used branches and pull requests to manage code contributions.
- 🧪 **Testing & Feedback** – Internal testing sessions and peer feedback loops helped us refine our work.
