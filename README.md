# Web Development Group Challenge

> A collaborative project built as part of the PLP Curriculum in Web Development.

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application developed during our group challenge using only the technologies covered in class. It demonstrates our teamwork, creativity, and understanding of web development principles—focusing on functionality, user experience, clean code, and responsiveness.

## Solution Approach

We started by brainstorming ideas together and selecting one that aligned well with the week's objectives. Using a shared planning document, we divided tasks based on individual strengths and interests. Our process included:

- **Wireframing & Planning** – Used zoom meeting for communication and whatsapp for back up.
- **Tech Stack** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap framework.
- **GitHub Collaboration** – We used branches and pull requests to manage code contributions.
- **Testing & Feedback** – Internal testing sessions and peer feedback loops helped us refine our work.
